    highTemps: 'Activity may spike in the cooler early morning hours, but as temperatures climb, birds will rest in the shade and remain mostly inactive.',
    highWindsButCold: 'Wind may decrease activity at your feeders, but lower temperatures may still drive birds to eat to replenish body fat stores.',
    cold: 'Low temperatures cause birds to burn more calories to stay warm. Hunger will drive them to easy food sources, keeping your feeders busy much of the day.',
    warmWithRain: 'With a high chance of rain, expect birds to visit your feeders shortly after the rain stops. You may see a burst of activity in the 1 - 2 hours after the rain stops.',
    warmLowWindOvercast: 'Cloudy skies will encourage prolonged bird activity, especially in the mid to late morning hours. Afternoon feeder activity will likely be sporadic, ranging from low to moderate.',
    warmLowWindSun: 'Activity may be good early morning, but otherwise will likely be low due to sun and warmer temperatures.'
